android-subtitle-api
====================
DISCLAIMER: this was an old repository to which I had worked in 2011, when my skills on Android development were really poor. I awlays wanted to publish it, but I did not have much time and I often forgot about it. I had no time to improve this code (at least to remove the hard-coded reference to the example files required to run) so you would need to change a little bit to make it work (but a lot to make it useful and reusable).

The purpose of this "project" was to parse a subtitle file and draw it on top of a video surface (with automatic synchronization between the video and the subtitle).
Currently supported format are Srt/Usf files.
